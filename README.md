# LoginExample
<p>
Here is the code test. I timebox myself to 1 hour..... But i did go over by 30 mins becausse I "Got in the zone" lol.

# Setup
<p>
	You will have to change appsettings.ConnectionStrings.LoginExample. The part that would need to change would be AttachDbFilename string to match your file structure.
	```csharp
	"ConnectionStrings": {
		"LoginExample": "Data Source=(LocalDB)\\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=G:\\git\\LoginExample\\LoginExample.Ui\\LoginExample.mdf;Integrated Security=True"
	} 
	```
